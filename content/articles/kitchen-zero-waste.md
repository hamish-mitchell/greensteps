Focus on high-frequency disposables first:

- Switch paper towels for a stack of washable cloth squares.
- Keep a freezer 'stock bag' for veggie offcuts â†’ future soup base.
- Label leftovers with date; a whiteboard pen on reusable lids works.

Composting: even a ventilated countertop caddy reduces smells & trips. If curbside service is absent, look for community gardens accepting scraps.
