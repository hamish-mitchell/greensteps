Cut standby waste first: plug strips, smart scheduling, and a kettle only filled to what you need. Then:

1. Drop your hot water thermostat a couple of degrees (still above 60°C storage; mix at tap).
2. Run full dishwasher and washing loads; choose eco cycles.
3. Seal obvious draughts around doors & vents.

A cheap energy meter can reveal surprise hogs—often entertainment gear left idling.
