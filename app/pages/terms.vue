      <p>
        Welcome to Greensteps. By creating an account or otherwise using our services, you agree to these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the service.
      </p>

      <h2>Definitions</h2>
      <p>
        "Service" means Greensteps and any related products, features, or content provided by us. "User Content" means any text, images, data, or other content you upload, submit or post to the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>Account</h2>
      <p>
        You must provide accurate information, keep your account credentials secure, and are responsible for activity that occurs under your account. Notify us immediately of any unauthorized use.
      </p>

      <h2>User Content</h2>
      <p>
        You retain ownership of User Content you submit. By submitting User Content you grant Greensteps a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, publish and display such content to operate and improve the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>
        All intellectual property rights in the Service (other than User Content) are owned by or licensed to Greensteps. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Service without prior written permission.
      </p>

      <h2>Acceptable Use & Prohibited Conduct</h2>
      <p>
        You agree not to: (a) use the Service for unlawful purposes; (b) harass, abuse or harm other users; (c) upload malicious code; or (d) attempt to interfere with the security or integrity of the Service. We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these rules.
      </p>

      <h2>Payments and Refunds</h2>
      <p>
        If you purchase paid features, additional terms may apply. Fees are non-refundable except as required by law or when otherwise stated. You are responsible for applicable taxes.
      </p>

      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        The Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free.
      </p>

      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, Greensteps and its affiliates will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages. Our aggregate liability arising from or related to these Terms will not exceed the greater of (a) the amounts you paid to Greensteps in the 12 months preceding the claim or (b) one hundred Australian dollars (AUD 100).
      </p>

      <h2>Indemnification</h2>
      <p>
        You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Greensteps, its officers, directors, employees, and agents from claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from your breach of these Terms or your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.
      </p>

      <h2>Termination</h2>
      <p>
        We may suspend or terminate access to the Service at any time for conduct that we believe violates these Terms or is harmful to other users or the Service. On termination, your right to use the Service ends but obligations that by their nature should survive (e.g., indemnification, limitation of liability, ownership and payment obligations) will survive.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms from time to time. If changes are material, we will provide notice in advance. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Victoria, Australia, without regard to conflict of law provisions. Any dispute arising under these Terms will be resolved in the state or federal courts located in Victoria, unless otherwise agreed in writing.
      </p>

      <h2>Grading and External Assessments</h2>
      <p>
        The Service does not guarantee or influence academic or professional assessments. Any grading decisions are made solely by the relevant institution or assessor and are outside our control.
      </p>
