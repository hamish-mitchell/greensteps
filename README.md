# Greensteps

Carbon footprint-tracking app built with Vue + Nuxt 4 for the frontend, and Supabase on the backend.

To run the app:

```bash
git clone https://hamish-mitchell/greensteps
cd greensteps
mv .env.example .env
```

And replace the supabase environment keys with your own. Then run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app has been tested to work on Windows & Linux. MacOS *should* work, but it isn't guaranteed.
